# Made-In-Raptor
Some other projects made in the Raptor programming language. Some will be old HW assignments, some will be things I made just for myself, like a Fallout 4 SPECIAL stat randomizer.

The idea for Fallout 4 was to make a totally random build generator, at least at first.

I got through making the SPECIAL stats generator, and decided to have an option for how many times you wanted to roll stats, because people like options, right?

One of these days I'm going to add in things like automatically choosing perks, but I'll probably have to ignore player Bobblehead selection and I don't think I'll be able to save builds, unless I upgrade to Python.
